# FindThatLoot
Sift through heaps of your gathered items. Datagrid with properties and mods search included, to find that one item you need. Deep deep in stashtab that its name you don't remember anymore.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Proof of concept, preloading sample data. Support for few preselected mods.
 

### Goals and features in not particular order, subject to change  
- [ ] Presenting data for one league of choice with first N stash tabs, last played character. Support for few selected mods. 

**Warning**: It's using same source of data as other apps that make you choose your tabs to supply their functionality. So there is a limit how often you can refresh stash tab/s of your choice. You will get info how long you have to wait to get refreshed content.
Eventualy I'll introduce ability to add your ctrl+C items maualy.
