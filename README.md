# FindThatLoot
Welcome Exile!

Sift through heaps of your gathered items with ease. Datagrid with properties and mods search included, to find that one item you need. Deep deep in stashtab that its name you don't remember anymore.

**Warning**: It's using same source of data as other apps that make you choose your tabs to supply their functionality. So there is a limit how often you can refresh stash tab/s of your choice. You will get info how long you have to wait to get refreshed content.
Eventualy I'll introduce ability to add your ctrl+C items maualy.
